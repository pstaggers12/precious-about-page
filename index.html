            <p>Welcome! My name is Precious Staggers, and I’m passionate about creating positive impacts through both my work and my relationships. Currently based in Dermott, AR where I am a dedicated professional with a diverse background in retail management, customer service, and early childhood education.</p>
            <p>With a great foundation in retail as both an Assistant Store Manager and Cashier at Dollar General, I’ve enhanced my leadership, organizational, and customer service skills. I thrive in fast-paced environments where teamwork and problem-solving are important. I’m excited to continue growing in a career where I can contribute to operational success and exceptional customer experience.</p>
            <p>Outside of retail, I have a passion for education and have worked as a Curriculum Coordinator, where I developed and managed programs that promoted growth and learning. This experience with my background in child care, has strengthened my ability to manage different teams and handle difficult situations with care and attention to detail.</p>
            <p>Currently, I’m pursuing a Bachelor’s in Computer Science, and I am eager to apply my technical and management skills in new, creative ways. I am always looking for opportunities to learn and grow, and I’m excited about the future ahead.</p>
